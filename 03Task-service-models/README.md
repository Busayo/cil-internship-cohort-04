## SERVICE MODELS

### **VMs (E2, VM, etc.)**  
A VM is generally considered **Infrastructure-as-a-Service**, as you retain responsibility for patching and managing the Virtual Machine Operating System. An AWS EC2 (or Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) is a type of virtual machine hosted on the AWS platform. While a VM in Azure is simply called a VM.

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a cloud computing infrastructure that provides compute, network, and storage resources over the internet, via a subscription model that can scale. Since itâ€™s offered as a subscription service, it can scale up or down as needed, providing greater flexibility compared to on-premise infrastructures.


### **Platforms (AppEngine, ElasticBeanStalk, etc.)**
Platforms such as AppEngine and ElasticBeanStalk are **Platform-as-a-Service**. These are platforms that help you deploy and manage web applications with capacity provisioning, app health monitoring, and more. ElasticBeanStalk is managed by AWS while AppEngine is managed by Google.

Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud infrastructure layer that provides resources to build user-level tools and applications. It includes the underlying infrastructure including compute, network, and storage resources, as well as development tools, database management systems, and middleware.

 
### **Functions (Lambda, Google/Azure functions)**
Functions such as Lambda Functions, Google/Azure Functions are usually grouped as Functions as a service. FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) is a type of cloud-computing service that allows you to execute code in response to events without the complex infrastructure typically associated with building and launching microservices applications.
